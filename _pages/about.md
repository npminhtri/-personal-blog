This is my personal blog. My undergraduate advisor - Professor Ha Tran - told me I should have a website. And here it is. 

I am a Vietnamese, as you might have know that from my name, the infamous "Nguyen". Although my first name is T-R-I, it is pronounced like "tree" in English, though I don't mind being called "try".  


I will usually post my academic information, such as: CV, classes  I taught etc. I also intent to create a page where I post my own post about what I learnt/am working on.
