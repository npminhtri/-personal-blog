 ## Problem: Let $f$ be an analytic function on the neighborhood of closed unit ball $\overline{B}(0,1)$. If $|f(z)| <1$ for $|z|=1$, show that $f$ has a unique fixed point inside $B(0,1)$? What happens if we replace the assumption $|f(z)| <1$ with $|f(z)|\le 1$ for all $|z|=1$?

The reason I wrote this note because I made a stupid mistake on MSE and provided an incorrect solution, so I am writing down it here to remind myself.
