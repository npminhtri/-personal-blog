In July, I am trying to self study some scheme theory to keep up with my peers in an algebraic group seminar. They've been using the text of Milne, which basically using scheme to study algebraic groups, so I have no choice. Fortunately, I found some course notes that cover the basic of Scheme theory - but the notes are in handritten version. So I think it is a good idea to transfer them on my blog in latex/ markdown form. 

The sources of the note is from here: [Scheme course](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=5073)

<span style="color:blue">SUMMARY OF AFFINE VARIETIES</span>.

We know that over algebraic closed field $k$, we have the corresponding

$$\begin{split}(\text{ subsets of } k^n \text{ cut out by a set of polynomials})/\cong  &\leftrightarrow (\text{finitely generated reduced $k-$ algebra})/\cong \\
\textcolor{yellow}{geometry} &\leftrightarrow  \textcolor{yellow}{algebra}\end{split}
$$
In particular, if we have an ideal $I \subset k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ then we can define an affine variety 
$$X = Z(I) = \left\lbrace a \in k^n | f(a) =0 \text{ for all } f \in I\right\rbrace$$
We also equip $k^n$ with a topology, which is $\textit{Zariski}$ topology. This topology is generated by the basis closed subset $Z(I)$ defined as above. We can also define the basis open to be 
$$D(f) = \left\lbrace a \in k^n | f(a) \ne 0 \right\rbrace $$
Usually we denote the space with this topology by $\mathbb{A}^n$. Any $X \subset \mathbb{A}^n$ is an induced topological space.
